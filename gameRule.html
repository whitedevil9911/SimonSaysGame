        <ul>
            <li>Press any key to start the game.</li>
            <li>A button will flash in a specific colorâ€”remember the sequence.</li>
            <li>Click the buttons in the correct order as they flashed.</li>
            <li>If you get the sequence wrong, the game ends, and your score will be displayed.</li>
            <li>The goal is to reach the highest level by repeating the sequence correctly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good Luck!</p>
